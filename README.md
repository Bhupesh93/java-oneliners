Java 8 - The Next Big JVM Language
==================================

## Introduction

Java one liners effort is to show why Java 8 Lambda Edition is a cool-kid on the block, not just for Java developers.
Here is my take of the one-liners fantasy using Java 8: https://github.com/aruld/java-oneliners/wiki

## Overview

The project uses bleeding edge builds of JDK 8 [lambdas](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/lambda/).
I am trying to put best effort in making the code up-to-date with the latest JDK 8 Collections lambdafication effort.
I hope these changes get settle down fairly soon, as milestone M6 deadline approaches which would be feature complete.

Check out the latest API docs [here](http://download.java.net/lambda/b73/docs/api/)

Download the latest build [here](http://jdk8.java.net/lambda/)

I use the best IDE in the Java world (Intellij 12) to develop these samples. It has incredible support for lambda and you'll never be disappointed.

Enjoy and watch this space for a fun ride!
